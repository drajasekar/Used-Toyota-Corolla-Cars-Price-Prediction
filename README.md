# Used-Toyota-Corolla-Cars-Price-Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of used Toyota Corolla cars based on various features such as age, mileage, model year, condition, and more. 

The prediction model leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate estimates, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

Features

Dataset: Contains historical data of Toyota Corolla car listings with features like age, mileage, model year, condition, and price.

Prediction Model: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, to predict car prices based on input features.

Usage

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and insights related to Toyota Corolla car prices.

Model Training: Train the prediction model using machine learning algorithms on the dataset. Use techniques like hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and validation to optimize performance.

Prediction: Deploy the trained model to predict the prices of used Toyota Corolla cars based on user input features.

Steps to Run:
Preprocess the dataset to clean, transform, and prepare the data for training.

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Train the machine learning model using the training set.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.

Deploy the model for real-time predictions or batch predictions as required.
